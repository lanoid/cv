            </h3>
            <p class="dates">July 2016 - Present</p>
            <p>I am a key part of the maturing Digital Group function at Whitbread, looking after search and helping teams work together through collaboratvie libraries and initiatives.</p>
            <p>During the summer of 2018 we released a new search results page, built purley in typescript, this has been designed from the ground up to be fast and efficient, it has already had a positive impact on revenue.</p>
            <p>Until autumn last year my team was taking care of the Premier Inn search and content pages. This included understanding stakeholder interests, pushing for re-devlopement and re-factoring and an unhealthy amount of bug fixing.</p>
            <p>While at Whitbread I have helped convince architects and management of the dangers of maintaining a four year old code base with no documentation - this has at times been difficult, but we have finally moved into prototyping and product development.</p>
            <p>I am working to improve coding standards and quality across teams, helping team members learn and upskill while providing decisions for the product teams.</p>
            <p>As a senior developer I lead and support initiatives across teams such as shared repositories, cross team code reviews, unit testing initiatives and more.</p>
            <p>I regularly attend, encourage and support discovery sessions between UX/UI, product owners and developers, my background in the creative industries supports this.</p>
            <p>I regularly help assess candidates for a selection of front end developer roles ensuring the quality of hiring remains high.</p>
            <p>I am a patient and sensitive teacher, helping guide graduates and developers through learning the pitfalls of front end development and helping the wider team with unfamiliar coding problems.</p>
            <p>I have pushed and encouraged other teams through example and experimentation to explore new opportunites in how they look at their projects.</p>
            <p>With my team we have delivered a pure javascript search results page which is many times faster and smaller than its predecessor, it is currently being tested on 5% of traffic with enouraging results.</p>
            <p>I have represented Whitbread at a Graduate hackathon and now work with one of the winners of the hackathon.</p>
            <p>I regularly help lead the developer forum, a place for all devs in all teams to share their ideas, present code and their projects.</p>
            <p>I attend and represent Whitbread at regular Accessibility Meetups and the super inclusive Dev Picnic.</p>
            <p>I have successfully argued for and helped to implement full unit testing for all features in my team, this has been adopted across most other web teams.</p>
            <p>I keep track of the various technologies of the different teams and regularly provide support.</p>
            <p>Championed and helped implement the single source of truth UI-Kit and continue to maintain it.</p>
            <p>I regularly help with incidents and live debugging of real time issues in a calm and professional manner.</p>

            <p class="dates">January 2012 - October 2013</p>
            <p>I decided to have a go at being a freelancer and working for Potato was an opportunity I did not want to pass up.</p>
            <p>The first large project I worked on was the Google Art Project where I helped develop and iterate through improving versions of the interface arriving at the final polished product.</p>
            <p>The Google Art Project allowed me to expand my knowledge of the JS framework Backbone and learn about the challenges posed by introducing multiple JS libraries in to a project.</p>
            <p>After the Art Project I moved to Getting Business Online, the American version of which has a presence in nearly every state and the international version having launched recently in Mexico and Indonesia, while already being present in many other countries.</p>
            <p>In the Getting Business Online sites I am working toward moving the different markets to Less CSS the goal of which is to compile one CSS file per market, with local parameters changing the style in each market.</p>
            <p>I am enjoying the complex use of Less that this affords me in creating a base stylesheet which can modified by the inclusion and compilation of the local stylesheet, this has brought back some of the joy of cascading stylesheets for me.</p>
            <p>The Getting Business Online project is enjoyable due to it’s enormous scope and the complexity of internationalisation and localisation.</p>
