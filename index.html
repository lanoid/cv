                        <p class="dates">January 2012 - October 2013</p>
                        <p>I decided to have a go at being a freelancer and working for Potato was an opportunity I did not want to pass up.</p>
                        <p>The first large project I worked on was the <a href="http://googleartproject.com">Google Art Project</a> where I helped develop and iterate through improving versions of the interface arriving at the final polished product.</p>
                        <p>The Google Art Project allowed me to expand my knowledge of the JS framework Backbone and learn about the challenges posed by introducing multiple JS libraries in to a project.</p>
                        <p>After the Art Project I moved to Getting Business Online, the American version of which has a presence in nearly every state and the international version having launched recently in Mexico and Indonesia, while already being present in many other countries.</p>
                        <p>In the Getting Business Online sites I am working toward moving the different markets to Less CSS the goal of which is to compile one CSS file per market, with local parameters changing the style in each market.</p>
                        <p>I am enjoying the complex use of Less that this affords me in creating a base stylesheet which can modified by the inclusion and compilation of the local stylesheet, this has brought back some of the joy of cascading stylesheets for me.</p>
                        <p>The Getting Business Online project is enjoyable due to it’s enormous scope and the complexity of internationalisation and localisation.</p>

                        <p>I work daily towards improving standards and enjoying the development community that thrives within the BBC.</p>
                        <p>I am applying my professional knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS in new and exciting ways, while working inside an agile scrum framework allowing the detailed planning, testing and execution of our projects.</p>
                        <p>I have pioneered the introduction and widespread use of requirejs and less which have improved the speed and portability of our product.</p>
                        <p>The development paradigms in current use are a mixture of BDD and TDD.</p>
                        <p>We constantly strive to adopt new technologies and innovations through hack and research days.</p>
                        <p>I am learning daily and hope to be able to pass this knowledge on to new starters in our team and within the BBC as a whole. I am still actively engaged in developing PHP for hack day projects, and when the need arises within the team.</p>
                        <p>The current discussion is how we as developers can best write and execute acceptance criteria based tests.</p>
                        <p>Alongside discussion with developers is the full embracing of UX and its implementaion and improvement throughout our product.</p>
                        <p>I work with a team of talented and dedicated people who are always willing to share problems, discuss and challenge new ideas and help drive each other to perfect the product we are creating.</p>
                        <p>I am currently working on an internal tool that allows BBC staff to publish editorial content throughout the various online platforms that the BBC provides.</p>

                        <p>Whilst at Yahoo! I worked with a highly creative team developing and selling client advertising briefs.</p>
                        <p>I created a PHP backbone that tied Yahoo! services together for our team into competitions, blogs and information driven advertising.</p>
                        <p>Within our department we always strived to provide a site that was both valuable and interesting for our users, which in turn generated engaged and lasting relationships between our clients and their customers.</p>
                        <p>I mainly worked in PHP, while sharpening my CSS2/3, HTML and JavaScript skill sets.</p>
                        <p>Working with a highly engaged team was an energising experience that inspired me to find a balance between new technologies, established user experience patterns and innovative design.</p>
                        <p>I also involved myself in the developer community while at Yahoo! attending many lightning talks and showcasing our work to drive inspiration within the company.</p>

                        <p>Design for Interactive Media gave me a sound understanding of the design principles that inform the visual landscape both on and offline in which we all live</p>
                        <p>The course enabled me to be critically aware of how design works in relation to a users direct experience of a product or service.</p>
